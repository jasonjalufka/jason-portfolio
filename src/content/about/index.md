Howdy! I'm Jason, a web developer living in Portland, OR, who enjoys doing things. I create websites and web apps that solve problems using modern technology stacks.

After graduating from [Texas State University](https://cs.txstate.edu/), I joined the Consumer Lending team at [USAA](https://www.usaa.com/) where I worked on developing compliant internal tools for the Consumer Loan platform.
